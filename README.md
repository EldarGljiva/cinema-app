## About

In this project I've built a custom API and integrated it with a MongoDB replica using `run-rs` npm module. I created routes to establish a connection between the frontend and backend. There are two main roles in the system: regular users and admins ( functionalities per role are listed below). I made the frontend using React, primarily utilizing Material-UI components, making sure it works well and is responsive.

## User Functionalities
- Register / Login
- Search / View Movies
- Book Movies
- Delete Bookings

## Admin Functionalities
- Login
- Add New Movies

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- NodeJS
- ExpressJS
- React
- HTML, CSS
- MongoDB
